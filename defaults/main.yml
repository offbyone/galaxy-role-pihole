# Configure dsnmasq with custom templates. The format here is a list of maps,
# with "src" and "name" keys. The name will be created in the pi-hole server's
# /etc/dnsmasq.d directory
#
# For example:
#
# pihole_dnsmasq_templates:
#   - src: additional_local_subnets.conf.j2
#     name: 05-local-subnets.conf

# Optionally support conditional forwarding. If this is set to a mapping, it'll
# be used to enable the CONDITIONAL_FORWARDING parts of the pihole config. For
# example:
# pihole_conditional_forwarding:
#   router_ip: 10.0.0.1
#   domain: example.com
